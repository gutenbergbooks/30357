<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr align="center" width="50">
<br>
<p>Many editions of Gray have been published in the last fifty years,
some of them very elegant, and some showing considerable editorial
labor, but not one, so far as I am aware, critically exact either in
text or in notes. No editor since Mathias (<small>A.D.</small> 1814) has given the
2d line of the <i>Elegy</i> as Gray wrote and printed it; while Mathias's
mispunctuation of the 123d line has been copied by his successors,
almost without exception. Other variations from the early editions
are mentioned in the notes.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the most accurate edition of Gray's
collected poems is the <i>editio princeps</i> of 1768, printed under his
own supervision. The first edition of the two Pindaric odes, <i>The
Progress of Poesy</i> and <i>The Bard</i> (Strawberry-Hill, 1757), was
printed with equal care, and the proofs were probably read by the
poet. The text of the present edition has been collated, line by
line, with that of these early editions, and in no instance have I
adopted a later reading. All the MS. variations, and the various
readings I have noted in the modern editions, are given in the notes.</p>

<p>Pickering's edition of 1835, edited by Mitford, has been followed
blindly in nearly all the more recent editions, and its many errors
(see foot-note <a href="#elegyfootnote10">below</a> and <a href="#etonfootnote2">also</a>) have been faithfully reproduced.
Even its blunders in the "indenting" of the lines in the
corresponding stanzas of the two Pindaric odes, which any careful
proof-reader ought to have corrected, have been copied again and
again&mdash;as in the Boston (1853) reprint of Pickering, the pretty
little edition of Bickers &amp; Son (London, n. d.), the fac-simile of
the latter printed at our University Press, Cambridge (1866), etc.</p>

<p>Of former editions of Gray, the only one very fully annotated is
Mitford's (Pickering, 1835), already mentioned. I have drawn freely
from that, correcting many errors, and also from Wakefield's and
Mason's editions, and from Hales's notes (<i>Longer English Poems</i>,
London, 1872) on the <i>Elegy</i> and the Pindaric odes. To all this
material many original notes and illustrations have been added.</p>

<p>The facts concerning the first publication of the <i>Elegy</i> are not
given correctly by any of the editors, and even the "experts" of
<i>Notes and Queries</i> have not been able to disentangle the snarl of
conflicting evidence. I am not sure that I have settled the question
myself (see <a href="#elegynotes1">below</a> and foot-note), but I have at least shown that Gray
is a more credible witness in the case than any of his critics. Their
testimony is obviously inconsistent and inconclusive; he may have
confounded the names of two magazines, but that remains to be
proved.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Since writing the above to-day, I have found by the
merest chance in my own library another bit of evidence in the case,
which fully confirms my surmise that the <i>Elegy</i> was printed in <i>The
Magazine of Magazines</i> before it appeared in the <i>Grand Magazine of
Magazines</i>. <i>Chambers's Book of Days</i> (vol. ii. p. 146), in an
article on "Gray and his Elegy," says:</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>"It first saw the light in <i>The Magazine of Magazines</i>, February,
1751. Some imaginary literary wag is made to rise in a convivial
assembly, and thus announce it: 'Gentlemen, give me leave to soothe
my own melancholy, and amuse you in a most noble manner, with a full
copy of verses by the very ingenious Mr. Gray, of Peterhouse,
Cambridge. They are stanzas written in a country churchyard.' Then
follow the verses. A few days afterwards, Dodsley's edition
appeared," etc.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The same authority gives the four stanzas omitted after the 18th (see
<a href="#elegynotes2">below</a>) as they appear in the <i>North American Review</i>, except that the
first line of the third is "Hark how the sacred calm that <i>reigns</i>
around," a reading which I have found nowhere else. The stanza "There
scattered oft," etc. (see <a href="#elegynotes3">below</a>), is given as in the review. The reading
further <a href="#elegynotes4">below</a> must be a later one.</small></blockquote>

<p>I have retained most of the "parallel passages" from the poets given
by the editors, and have added others, without regard to the critics
who have sneered at this kind of annotations. Whether Gray borrowed
from the others, or the others from him, matters little; very likely,
in most instances, neither party was consciously the borrower. Gray,
in his own notes, has acknowledged certain debts to other poets, and
probably these were all that he was aware of. Some of these he
contracted unwittingly (see what he says of one of them in a letter
to Walpole, quoted in the note on the <i>Ode on the Spring</i>, <a href="#springl31">31</a>), and
the same may have been true of some apparently similar cases pointed
out by modern editors. To me, however, the chief interest of these
coincidences and resemblances of thought or expression is as studies
in the "comparative anatomy" of poetry. The teacher will find them
useful as pegs to hang questions upon, or texts for oral instruction.
The pupil, or the young reader, who finds out who all these poets
were, when they lived, what they wrote, etc., will have learned no
small amount of English literary history. If he studies the
quotations merely as illustrations of style and expression, or as
examples of the poetic diction of various periods, he will have
learned some lessons in the history and the use of his mother-tongue.</p>

<h3>THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY.</h3>

<center>B<small>Y</small> R<small>OBERT</small> C<small>ARRUTHERS</small>.</center><br>
<hr align="center" width="100">
<br>
<p>Thomas Gray, the author of the celebrated <i>Elegy written in a Country
Churchyard</i>, was born in Cornhill, London, December 26, 1716. His
father, Philip Gray, an exchange broker and scrivener, was a wealthy
and nominally respectable citizen, but he treated his family with
brutal severity and neglect, and the poet was altogether indebted for
the advantages of a learned education to the affectionate care and
industry of his mother, whose maiden name was Antrobus, and who, in
conjunction with a maiden sister, kept a millinery shop. A brother of
Mrs. Gray was assistant to the Master of Eton, and was also a fellow
of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Under his protection the poet was
educated at Eton, and from thence went to Peterhouse, attending
college from 1734 to September, 1738. At Eton he had as
contemporaries Richard West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland,
and Horace Walpole, son of the triumphant Whig minister, Sir Robert
Walpole. West died early in his 26th year, but his genius and virtues
and his sorrows will forever live in the correspondence of his
friend. In the spring of 1739, Gray was invited by Horace Walpole to
accompany him as travelling companion in a tour through France and
Italy. They made the usual route, and Gray wrote remarks on all he
saw in Florence, Rome, Naples, etc. His observations on arts and
antiquities, and his sketches of foreign manners, evince his
admirable taste, learning, and discrimination. Since Milton, no such
accomplished English traveller had visited those classic shores. In
their journey through Dauphiny, Gray's attention was strongly
arrested by the wild and picturesque site of the Grande Chartreuse,
surrounded by its dense forest of beech and fir, its enormous
precipices, cliffs, and cascades. He visited it a second time on his
return, and in the album of the mountain convent he wrote his famous
Alcaic Ode. At Reggio the travellers quarrelled and parted. Walpole
took the whole blame on himself. He was fond of pleasure and
amusements, "intoxicated by vanity, indulgence, and the insolence of
his situation as a prime minister's son"&mdash;his own confession&mdash;while
Gray was studious, of a serious disposition, and independent spirit.
The immediate cause of the rupture is said to have been Walpole's
clandestinely opening, reading, and resealing a letter addressed to
Gray, in which he expected to find a confirmation of his suspicions
that Gray had been writing unfavourably of him to some friends in
England. A partial reconciliation was effected about three years
afterwards by the intervention of a lady, and Walpole redeemed his
youthful error by a life-long sincere admiration and respect for his
friend. From Reggio Gray proceeded to Venice, and thence travelled
homewards, attended by a <i>laquais de voyage</i>. He arrived in England
in September, 1741, having been absent about two years and a half.
His father died in November, and it was found that the poet's fortune
would not enable him to prosecute the study of the law. He therefore
retired to Cambridge, and fixed his residence at the university.
There he continued for the remainder of his life, with the exception
of about two years spent in London, when the treasures of the British
Museum were thrown open. At Cambridge he had the range of noble
libraries. His happiness consisted in study, and he perused with
critical attention the Greek and Roman poets, philosophers,
historians, and orators. Plato and the Anthologia he read and
annotated with great care, as if for publication. He compiled tables
of Greek chronology, added notes to Linnæus and other naturalists,
wrote geographical disquisitions on Strabo; and, besides being
familiar with French and Italian literature, was a zealous
archæological student, and profoundly versed in architecture, botany,
painting, and music. In all departments of human learning, except
mathematics, he was a master. But it follows that one so studious, so
critical, and so fastidious, could not be a voluminous writer. A few
poems include all the original compositions of Gray&mdash;the
quintessence, as it were, of thirty years of ceaseless study and
contemplation, irradiated by bright and fitful gleams of inspiration.
In 1742 Gray composed his <i>Ode to Spring</i>, his <i>Ode on a Distant
Prospect of Eton College</i>, and his <i>Ode to Adversity</i>&mdash;productions
which most readers of poetry can repeat from memory. He commenced a
didactic poem, <i>On the Alliance of Education and Government</i>, but
wrote only about a hundred lines. Every reader must regret that this
philosophical poem is but a fragment. It is in the style and measure
of Dryden, of whom Gray was an ardent admirer and close student. His
<i>Elegy written in a Country Churchyard</i> was completed and published
in 1751. In the form of a sixpenny <i>brochure</i> it circulated rapidly,
four editions being exhausted the first year. This popularity
surprised the poet. He said sarcastically that it was owing entirely
to the subject, and that the public would have received it as well if
it had been written in prose. The solemn and affecting nature of the
poem, applicable to all ranks and classes, no doubt aided its sale;
it required high poetic sensibility and a cultivated taste to
appreciate the rapid transitions, the figurative language, and
lyrical magnificence of the odes; but the elegy went home to all
hearts; while its musical harmony, originality, and pathetic train of
sentiment and feeling render it one of the most perfect of English
poems. No vicissitudes of taste or fashion have affected its
popularity. When the original manuscript of the poem was lately
(1854) offered for sale, it brought the almost incredible sum of &pound;131.
The two great odes of Gray, <i>The Progress of Poetry</i> and <i>The
Bard</i>, were published in 1757, and were but coldly received. His
name, however, stood high, and on the death of Cibber, the same year,
he was offered the laureateship, which he wisely declined. He was
ambitious, however, of obtaining the more congenial and dignified
appointment of Professor of Modern History in the University of
Cambridge, which fell vacant in 1762, and, by the advice of his
friends, he made application to Lord Bute, but was unsuccessful. Lord
Bute had designed it for the tutor of his son-in-law, Sir James
Lowther. No one had heard of the tutor, but the Bute influence was
all-prevailing. In 1765 Gray took a journey into Scotland,
penetrating as far north as Dunkeld and the Pass of Killiecrankie;
and his account of his tour, in letters to his friends, is replete
with interest and with touches of his peculiar humour and graphic
description. One other poem proceeded from his pen. In 1768 the
Professorship of Modern History was again vacant, and the Duke of
Grafton bestowed it upon Gray. A sum of &pound;400 per annum was thus
added to his income; but his health was precarious&mdash;he had lost it,
he said, just when he began to be easy in his circumstances. The
nomination of the Duke of Grafton to the office of Chancellor of the
University enabled Gray to acknowledge the favour conferred on
himself. He thought it better that gratitude should sing than
expectation, and he honoured his grace's installation with an ode.
Such occasional productions are seldom happy; but Gray preserved his
poetic dignity and select beauty of expression. He made the founders
of Cambridge, as Mr. Hallam has remarked, "pass before our eyes like
shadows over a magic glass." When the ceremony of the installation
was over, the poet-professor went on a tour to the lakes of
Cumberland and Westmoreland, and few of the beauties of the
lake-country, since so famous, escaped his observation. This was to
be his last excursion. While at dinner one day in the college-hall he
was seized with an attack of gout in his stomach, which resisted all
the powers of medicine, and proved fatal in less than a week. He died
on the 30th of July, 1771, and was buried, according to his own
desire, beside the remains of his mother at Stoke-Pogis, near Slough,
in Buckinghamshire, in a beautiful sequestered village churchyard
that is supposed to have furnished the scene of his elegy.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> The
literary habits and personal peculiarities of Gray are familiar to us
from the numerous representations and allusions of his friends. It is
easy to fancy the recluse-poet sitting in his college-chambers in the
old quadrangle of Pembroke Hall. His windows are ornamented with
mignonette and choice flowers in China vases, but outside may be
discerned some iron-work intended to be serviceable as a fire-escape,
for he has a horror of fire. His furniture is neat and select; his
books, rather for use than show, are disposed around him. He has a
harpsichord in the room. In the corner of one of the apartments is a
trunk containing his deceased mother's dresses, carefully folded up
and preserved. His fastidiousness, bordering upon effeminacy, is
visible in his gait and manner&mdash;in his handsome features and small,
well-dressed person, especially when he walks abroad and sinks the
author and hard student in "the gentleman who sometimes writes for
his amusement." He writes always with a crow-quill, speaks slowly and
sententiously, and shuns the crew of dissonant college revellers, who
call him "a prig," and seek to annoy him. Long mornings of study, and
nights feverish from ill-health, are spent in those chambers; he is
often listless and in low spirits; yet his natural temper is not
desponding, and he delights in employment. He has always something to
learn or to communicate&mdash;some sally of humour or quiet stroke of
satire for his friends and correspondents&mdash;some note on natural
history to enter in his journal&mdash;some passage of Plato to unfold and
illustrate&mdash;some golden thought of classic inspiration to inlay on
his page&mdash;some bold image to tone down&mdash;some verse to retouch and
harmonize. His life is on the whole innocent and happy, and a feeling
of thankfulness to the Great Giver is breathed over all.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> A claim has been put up for the churchyard of
Granchester, about two miles from Cambridge, the great bell of St.
Mary's serving for the "curfew." But Stoke-Pogis is more likely to
have been the spot, if any individual locality were indicated. The
poet often visited the village, his aunt and mother residing there,
and his aunt was interred in the churchyard of the place. Gray's
epitaph on his mother is characterized not only by the tenderness
with which he always regarded her memory, but by his style and cast
of thought. It runs thus: "Beside her friend and sister here sleep
the remains of Dorothy Gray, widow, the careful, tender mother of
many children, one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her.
She died March 11, 1753, aged 72." She had lived to read the <i>Elegy</i>,
which was perhaps an ample recompense for her maternal cares and
affection. Mrs. Gray's will commences in a similar touching strain:
"In the name of God, amen. This is the last will and desire of
Dorothy Gray to her son Thomas Gray." [Cunningham's edit. of
<i>Johnson's Lives</i>.] They were all in all to each other. The father's
cruelty and neglect, their straitened circumstances, the sacrifices
made by the mother to maintain her son at the university, her pride
in the talents and conduct of that son, and the increasing gratitude
and affection of the latter, nursed in his scholastic and cloistered
solitude&mdash;these form an affecting but noble record in the history of
genius.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>[One would infer from the above that Mrs. Gray was <i>not</i> "interred in
the churchyard of the place," though the epitaph given immediately
after shows that she <i>was</i>. Gray in his will directed that he should
be laid beside her there. The passage in the will reads thus: "First,
I do desire that my body may be deposited in the vault, made by my
dear mother in the churchyard of Stoke-Pogeis, near Slough in
Buckinghamshire, by her remains, in a coffin of seasoned oak, neither
lined nor covered, and (unless it be inconvenient) I could wish that
one of my executors may see me laid in the grave, and distribute
among such honest and industrious poor persons in said parish as he
thinks fit, the sum of ten pounds in charity."&mdash;<i>Ed</i>.]</small></blockquote>

<p>Various editions of the collected works of Gray have been published.
The first, including memoirs of his life and his correspondence,
edited by his friend, the Rev. W. Mason, appeared in 1775. It has
been often reprinted, and forms the groundwork of the editions by
Mathias (1814) and Mitford (1816). Mr. Mitford, in 1843, published
Gray's correspondence with the Rev. Norton Nicholls; and in 1854
another collection of Gray's letters was published, edited also by
Mr. Mitford. Every scrap of the poet's MSS. is eagerly sought after,
and every year seems to add to his popularity as a poet and
letter-writer.</p>

<p>It is at Stoke-Pogis that we seek the most attractive vestiges of
Gray. Here he used to spend his vacations, not only when a youth at
Eton, but during the whole of his future life, while his mother and
his aunts lived. Here it was that his <i>Ode on a Distant Prospect of
Eton College</i>, his celebrated <i>Elegy written in a Country
Churchyard</i>, and his <i>Long Story</i> were not only written, but were
mingled with the circumstances and all the tenderest feelings of his
own life.</p>

<p>His mother and aunts lived at an old-fashioned house in a very
retired spot at Stoke, called West-End. This house stood in a hollow,
much screened by trees. A small stream ran through the garden, and it
is said that Gray used to employ himself when here much in this
garden, and that many of the trees still remaining are of his
planting. On one side of the house extended an upland field, which
was planted round so as to give a charming retired walk; and at the
summit of the field was raised an artificial mound, and upon it was
built a sort of arcade or summer-house, which gave full prospect of
Windsor and Eton. Here Gray used to delight to sit; here he was
accustomed to read and write much; and it is just the place to
inspire the <i>Ode on Eton College</i>, which lay in the midst of its fine
landscape, beautifully in view. The old house inhabited by Gray and
his mother has just been pulled down, and replaced by an Elizabethan
mansion by the present proprietor, Mr. Penn, of Stoke Park, just
by.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> The garden, of course, has shared in the change, and now
stands gay with its fountain and its modern greenhouse, and,
excepting for some fine trees, no longer reminds you of Gray. The
woodland walk still remains round the adjoining field, and the
summer-house on its summit, though now much cracked by time, and only
held together by iron cramps. The trees are now so lofty that they
completely obstruct the view, and shut out both Eton and Windsor.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> This was written (or published, at least) in 1846; but
Mitford, in the Life of Gray prefixed to the "Eton edition" of his
Poems, published in 1847, says: "The house, which is now called
<i>West-End</i>, lies in a secluded part of the parish, on the road to
Fulmer. It has lately been much enlarged and adorned by its present
proprietor [Mr. Penn], but the room called 'Gray's' (distinguished by
a small balcony) is still preserved; and a shady walk round an
adjoining meadow, with a summer-house on the rising land, are still
remembered as favourite places frequented by the poet."&mdash;<i>Ed</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Stoke Park is about a couple of miles from Slough. The country is
flat, but its monotony is broken up by the noble character and
disposition of its woods. Near the house is a fine expanse of water,
across which the eye falls on fine views, particularly to the south,
of Windsor Castle, Cooper's Hill, and the Forest Woods. About three
hundred yards from the north front of the house stands a column,
sixty-eight feet high, bearing on the top a colossal statue of Sir
Edward Coke, by Rosa. The woods of the park shut out the view of
West-End House, Gray's occasional residence, but the space is open
from the mansion across the park, so as to take in the view both of
the church and of a monument erected by the late Mr. Penn to Gray.
Alighting from the carriage at a lodge, we enter the park just at the
monument. This is composed of fine freestone, and consists of a large
sarcophagus, supported on a square pedestal, with inscriptions on
each side. Three of them are selected from the <i>Ode on Eton College</i>
and the <i>Elegy</i>. They are:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem2">
	<tr><td><small>Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;<br>
		Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.<br>
		<br>
		One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the heath, and near his fav'rite tree;<br>
		Another came; nor yet beside the rill,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he.</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The second is from the <i>Ode:</i></p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem3">
	<tr><td><small>Ye distant spires! ye antique towers!<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crown the watery glade,<br>
		Where grateful Science still adores<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Henry's holy shade;<br>
		And ye, that from the stately brow<br>
		Of Windsor's heights th' expanse below<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey,<br>
		Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among<br>
		Wanders the hoary Thames along<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His silver-winding way.<br>
		<br>
		Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, fields belov'd in vain!<br>
		Where once my careless childhood stray'd,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger yet to pain!<br>
		I feel the gales that from ye blow,<br>
		A momentary bliss bestow.</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The third is again from the <i>Elegy:</i></p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem4">
	<tr><td><small>Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,<br>
		Each in his narrow cell forever laid,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.<br>
		<br>
		The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,<br>
		The cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The fourth bears this inscription:</p>

<center><small>This Monument, in honour of<br>
T<small>HOMAS</small> G<small>RAY</small>,<br>
Was erected A.D. 1799,<br>
Among the scenery<br>
Celebrated by that great Lyric and Elegiac Poet.<br>
He died in 1771,<br>
And lies unnoted in the adjoining Church-yard,<br>
Under the Tomb-stone on which he piously<br>
And pathetically recorded the interment<br>
Of his Aunt and lamented Mother.</small></center>

<p>This monument is in a neatly kept garden-like enclosure, with a
winding walk approaching from the shade of the neighbouring trees. To
the right, across the park, at some little distance, backed by fine
trees, stands the rural little church and churchyard where Gray wrote
his <i>Elegy</i>, and where he lies. As you walk on to this, the mansion
closes the distant view between the woods with fine effect. The
church has often been engraved, and is therefore tolerably familiar
to the general reader. It consists of two barn-like structures, with
tall roofs, set side by side, and the tower and finely tapered spire
rising above them at the northwest corner. The church is thickly hung
with ivy, where</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem5">
	<tr><td><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moping owl may to the moon complain<br>
		Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molest her ancient, solitary reign."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The structure is as simple and old-fashioned, both without and
within, as any village church can well be. No village, however, is to
be seen. Stoke consists chiefly of scattered houses, and this is now
in the midst of the park. In the churchyard,</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem6">
	<tr><td><small>"Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Each in his narrow cell forever laid,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep."</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>All this is quite literal; and the tomb of the poet himself, near the
southeast window, completes the impression of the scene. It is a
plain brick altar tomb, covered with a blue slate slab, and, besides
his own ashes, contains those of his mother and aunt. On the slab are
inscribed the following lines by Gray himself: "In the vault beneath
are deposited, in hope of a joyful resurrection, the remains of <i>Mary
Antrobus</i>. She died unmarried, Nov. 5, 1749, aged sixty-six. In the
same pious confidence, beside her friend and sister, here sleep the
remains of <i>Dorothy Gray</i>, widow; the careful, tender mother of many
children, <small>ONE</small> of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her. She
died, March 11, 1753, aged LXXII."</p>

<p>No testimony of the interment of Gray in the same tomb was inscribed
anywhere till Mr. Penn, in 1799, erected the monument already
mentioned, and placed a small slab in the wall, under the window,
opposite to the tomb itself, recording the fact of Gray's burial
there. The whole scene is well worthy of a summer day's stroll,
especially for such as, pent in the metropolis, know how to enjoy the
quiet freshness of the country and the associations of poetry and the
past.</p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The untaught harmony of spring;<br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy murmur glows!<br>
		The insect youth are on the wing,<br>
		Eager to taste the honied spring,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And float amid the liquid noon:<br>
		Some lightly o'er the current skim,<br>
		Some show their gayly-gilded trim<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick-glancing to the sun.<br>
		<a name="spring4"></a><br>
		To Contemplation's sober eye<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the race of Man;<br>
		And they that creep, and they that fly,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall end where they began.<br>
		Alike the busy and the gay<br>
		But flutter thro' life's little day,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fortune's varying colours drest:<br>
		Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,<br>
		Or chill'd by age, their airy dance<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They leave, in dust to rest.<br>
		<a name="spring5"></a><br>
		Methinks I hear in accents low<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sportive kind reply:<br>
		Poor moralist! and what art thou?<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solitary fly!<br>
		Thy joys no glittering female meets,<br>
		No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No painted plumage to display:<br>
		On hasty wings thy youth is flown;<br>
		Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone&mdash;<br>

<h4>ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.</h4>
<br>

<p>This poem was begun in the year 1742, but was not finished until
1750, when Gray sent it to Walpole with a letter (dated June 12,
1750) in which he says: "I have been here at Stoke a few days (where
I shall continue good part of the summer), and having put an end to a
thing, whose beginning you have seen long ago, I immediately send it
you. You will, I hope, look upon it in the light of a thing with an
end to it: a merit that most of my writings have wanted, and are like
to want." It was shown in manuscript to some of the author's friends,
and was published in 1751 only because it was about to be printed
surreptitiously.</p>

<p>February 11, 1751, Gray wrote to Walpole that the proprietors of "the
Magazine of Magazines" were about to publish his <i>Elegy</i>, and added,
"I have but one bad way left to escape the honour they would inflict
upon me; and therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley
print it immediately (which may be done in less than a week's time)
from your copy, but without my name, in what form is most convenient
for him, but on his best paper and character; he must correct the
press himself,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> and print it without any interval between the
stanzas, because the sense is in some places continued beyond them;
and the title must be&mdash;'Elegy, written in a Country Churchyard.' If
he would add a line or two to say it came into his hands by accident,
I should like it better." Walpole did as requested, and wrote an
advertisement to the effect that accident alone brought the poem
before the public, although an apology was unnecessary to any but the
author. On which Gray wrote, "I thank you for your advertisement,
which saves my honour."</p>
<a name="elegyfootnote1"></a>
<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Dodsley's proof-reading must have been somewhat
careless, for there are many errors of the press in this <i>editio
princeps</i>. Gray writes to Walpole, under date of "Ash-Wednesday,
Cambridge, 1751," as follows: "Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or
two in the cradle, that (I doubt) it will bear the marks of as long
as it lives. But no matter: we have ourselves suffered under her
hands before now; and besides, it will only look the more careless
and by <i>accident</i> as it were." Again, March 3, 1751, he writes: "I do
not expect any more editions; as I have appeared in more magazines
than one. The chief errata were <i>sacred</i> for <i>secret;</i> <i>hidden</i> for
<i>kindred</i> (in spite of dukes and classics); and '<i>frowning</i> as in
scorn' for <i>smiling</i>. I humbly propose, for the benefit of Mr.
Dodsley and his matrons, that take <i>awake</i> [in line 92, which at
first read "awake and faithful to her wonted fires"] for a verb, that
they should read <i>asleep</i>, and all will be right." Other errors were,
"Their <i>harrow</i> oft the stubborn glebe," "And read their <i>destiny</i> in
a nation's eyes," "With uncouth rhymes and shapeless <i>culture</i>
decked," "Slow through the churchway <i>pass</i>," and many of minor
importance.</small></blockquote>
<a name="elegynotes1"></a>
<p>A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, June 12, 1875, states that the poem
first appeared in the <i>London Magazine</i>, March, 1751, p. 134, and
that "the Magazine of Magazines" is "a gentle term of scorn used by
Gray to indicate" that periodical, and not the name of any actual
magazine. But in the next number of <i>Notes and Queries</i> (June 19,
1875) Mr. F. Locker informs us that he has in his possession a
title-page of the <i>Grand Magazine of Magazines</i>, and the page of the
number for April, 1751, which contains the <i>Elegy</i>. The magazine is
said to be "collected and digested by Roger Woodville, Esq.," and
"published by Cooper at the Globe, in Pater Noster Row."</p>

<p>Gray says nothing in his letters of the appearance of the <i>Elegy</i> in
the <i>London Magazine</i>. The full title of that periodical was "The
London Magazine: or Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer." The editor's
name was not given; the publisher was "R. Baldwin, jun. at the Rose
in Pater-Noster Row." The volume for 1751 was the 20th, and the
Preface (written at the close of the year) begins thus: "As the two
most formidable Enemies we have ever had, are now extinct, we have
great Reason to conclude, that it is only the Merit, and real
Usefulness of our C<small>OLLECTION</small>, that hath supported its Sale and
Reputation for Twenty Years." A foot-note informs us that the
"Enemies" are the "<i>Magazine of Magazines</i> and <i>Grand Magazine of
Magazines;</i>" from which it would appear that there were two
periodicals of similar name published in London in 1751.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> May not the <i>Elegy</i> have been printed in both of these?
We do not know how otherwise to reconcile the conflicting statements
concerning the "Magazine of Magazines," as Gray calls it. In the
first place, Gray appears (from other portions of his letter to
Walpole) to be familiar with this magazine, and would not be likely
to confound it with another of similar name. Then, as we have seen,
he writes <i>early in March</i> to Walpole that the poem has been printed
"in more magazines than one." This cannot refer to the <i>Grand
Magazine of Magazines</i>, if, as Mr. Locker states, it was the <i>April</i>
number of that periodical in which the poem appeared. Nor can it
refer to the <i>London Magazine</i>, as it is clear from internal evidence
that the March number, containing the <i>Elegy</i>, was not issued until
early in April. It contains a summary of current news down to Sunday,
March 31, and the price of stocks in the London market for March 30.
The <i>February</i> number, in its "monthly catalogue" of new books,
records the publication of the <i>Elegy</i> by Dodsley thus: "An Elegy
wrote in a Church-yard, pr. 6d. Dodsley."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>If, then, the <i>Elegy</i> did not appear in either the <i>London Magazine</i>
or the <i>Grand Magazine of Magazines</i> until more than a month (in the
case of the latter, perhaps two months) after Dodsley had issued it,
in what magazine was it that it <i>did</i> appear just before he issued
it? The <i>N. A. Review</i> says that "it was a close race between the
Magazine and Dodsley; but the former, having a little the start, came
out a few days ahead." If so, it must have been the <i>March</i> number;
or the <i>February</i> one, if it was published, like the <i>London</i>, at the
end of the month. Gray calls it "the Magazine of Magazines," and we
shall take his word for it until we have reason for doubting it. What
else was included in his "more magazines than one" we cannot even
guess.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>We have not been able to find the <i>Magazine of Magazines</i> or the
<i>Grand Magazine of Magazines</i> in the libraries, and know nothing
about either "of our own knowledge." The <i>London Magazine</i> is in the
Harvard College Library, and the statements concerning that we can
personally vouch for.</small></blockquote>

<p>The author's name is not given with the <i>Elegy</i> as printed in the
<i>London Magazine</i>. The poem is sandwiched between an "Epilogue to
<i>Alfred, a Masque</i>" and some coarse rhymes entitled "Strip-Me-Naked,
or Royal Gin for ever." There is not even a printer's "rule" or
"dash" to separate the title of the latter from the last line of the
<i>Elegy</i>. The poem is more correctly printed than in Dodsley's
authorized edition; though, queerly enough, it has "winds" in the
second line and the parenthesis "(all he had)" in the Epitaph. Of
Dodsley's misprints noted above it has only "Their <i>harrow</i> oft" and
"shapeless <i>culture</i>." These four errors, indeed, are the only ones
worth noting, except "Or <i>wake</i> to extasy the living lyre."</p>

<p>The "Magazine of Magazines" (as the writer in the <i>North American
Review</i> tells us) printed the <i>Elegy</i> with the author's name. The
authorized though anonymous edition was thus briefly noticed by <i>The
Monthly Review</i>, the critical Rhadamanthus of the day: "<i>An Elegy in
a Country Churchyard</i>. 4to. Dodsley's. Seven pages.&mdash;The excellence
of this little piece amply compensates for its want of quantity."</p>

<p>"Soon after its publication," says Mason, "I remember, sitting with
Mr. Gray in his College apartment, he expressed to me his surprise at
the rapidity of its sale. I replied:</p>

<center><small>'Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.'</small></center>

<p>He paused awhile, and taking his pen, wrote the line on a printed
copy of it lying on his table. 'This,' said he, 'shall be its future
motto.' 'Pity,' cried I, 'that Dr. Young's Night Thoughts have
preoccupied it.' 'So,' replied he, 'indeed it is.'" Gray himself
tells the story of its success on the margin of the manuscript copy
of the <i>Elegy</i> preserved at Cambridge among his papers, and
reproduced in <i>fac-simile</i> in Mathias's elegant edition of the poet.
The following is a careful transcript of the memorandum:</p>

<p>"One peculiar and remarkable tribute to the merit of the <i>Elegy</i>,"
says Professor Henry Reed, "is to be noticed in the great number of
translations which have been made of it into various languages, both
of ancient and modern Europe. It is the same kind of tribute which
has been rendered to <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and to <i>The Pilgrim's
Progress</i>, and is proof of the same universality of interest,
transcending the limits of language and of race. To no poem in the
English language has the same kind of homage been paid so abundantly.
Of what other poem is there a polyglot edition? Italy and England
have competed with their polyglot editions of the <i>Elegy:</i> Torri's,
bearing the title, 'Elegia di Tomaso Gray sopra un Cimitero di
Campagna, tradotta dall' Inglese in più lingue: Verona, 1817;
Livorno, 1843;' and Van Voorst's London edition." Professor Reed adds
a list of the translations (which, however, is incomplete), including
one in Hebrew, seven in Greek, twelve in Latin, thirteen in Italian,
fifteen in French, six in German, and one in Portuguese.</p>

<p>"Had Gray written nothing but his <i>Elegy</i>," remarks Byron, "high as
he stands, I am not sure that he would not stand higher; it is the
cornerstone of his glory."</p>

<p>The tribute paid the poem by General Wolfe is familiar to all, but we
cannot refrain from quoting Lord Mahon's beautiful account of it in
his <i>History of England</i>. On the night of September 13th, 1759, the
night before the battle on the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe was
descending the St. Lawrence with a part of his troops. The historian
says: "Swiftly, but silently, did the boats fall down with the tide,
unobserved by the enemy's sentinels at their posts along the shore.
Of the soldiers on board, how eagerly must every heart have throbbed
at the coming conflict! how intently must every eye have contemplated
the dark outline, as it lay pencilled upon the midnight sky, and as
every moment it grew closer and clearer, of the hostile heights! Not
a word was spoken&mdash;not a sound heard beyond the rippling of the
stream. Wolfe alone&mdash;thus tradition has told us&mdash;repeated in a low
tone to the other officers in his boat those beautiful stanzas with
which a country churchyard inspired the muse of Gray. One noble line,</p>

<center><small>'The paths of glory lead but to the grave,'</small></center>

<p>must have seemed at such a moment fraught with mournful meaning. At
the close of the recitation Wolfe added, 'Now, gentlemen, I would
rather be the author of that poem than take Quebec.'"</p>

<p>Hales, in his Introduction to the poem, remarks: "The <i>Elegy</i> is
perhaps the most widely known poem in our language. The reason of
this extensive popularity is perhaps to be sought in the fact that it
expresses in an exquisite manner feelings and thoughts that are
universal. In the current of ideas in the <i>Elegy</i> there is perhaps
nothing that is rare, or exceptional, or out of the common way. The
musings are of the most rational and obvious character possible; it
is difficult to conceive of any one musing under similar
circumstances who should not muse so; but they are not the less deep
and moving on this account. The mystery of life does not become
clearer, or less solemn and awful, for any amount of contemplation.
Such inevitable, such everlasting questions as rise on the mind when
one lingers in the precincts of Death can never lose their freshness,
never cease to fascinate and to move. It is with such questions, that
would have been commonplace long ages since if they could ever be so,
that the <i>Elegy</i> deals. It deals with them in no lofty philosophical
manner, but in a simple, humble, unpretentious way, always with the
truest and the broadest humanity. The poet's thoughts turn to the
poor; he forgets the fine tombs inside the church, and thinks only of
the 'mouldering heaps' in the churchyard. Hence the problem that
especially suggests itself is the potential greatness, when they
lived, of the 'rude forefathers' that now lie at his feet. He does
not, and cannot solve it, though he finds considerations to mitigate
the sadness it must inspire; but he expresses it in all its awfulness
in the most effective language and with the deepest feeling; and his
expression of it has become a living part of our language."</p>

<p>The writer in the <i>North American Review</i> (vol. 96) from whom we have
elsewhere quoted says of the <i>Elegy:</i> "It is upon this that Gray's
fame as a poet must chiefly rest. By this he will be known forever
alike to the lettered and the unlettered. Many, in future ages, who
may never have heard of his classic Odes, his various learning, or
his sparkling letters, will revere him only as the author of the
<i>Elegy</i>. For this he will be enshrined through all time in the hearts
of the myriads who shall speak our English tongue. For this his name
will be held in glad remembrance in the far-off summer isles of the
Pacific, and amidst the waste of polar snows. If he had written
nothing else, his place as a leading poet in our language would still
be assured. Many have asserted, with Johnson, that he was a mere
mechanical poet&mdash;one who brought from without, but never found
within; that the gift of inspiration was not native to him; that his
imagination was borrowed finery, his fancy tinsel, and his invention
the world's well-worn jewels; that whatever in his verse was poetic
was not new, and what was new was not poetic; that he was only an
unworldly dyspeptic, living amid many books, and laboriously delving
for a lifetime between musty covers, picking out now and then
another's gems and bits of ore, and fashioning them into
ill-compacted mosaics, which he wrongly called his own. To all this
the <i>Elegy</i> is a sufficient answer. It is not old&mdash;it is not bookish;
it is new and human. Books could not make its maker: he was born of
the divine breath alone. Consider all the commentators, the
scholiasts, the interpreters, the annotators, and other like
book-worms, from Aristarchus down to Döderlein; and may it not be
said that, among them all, 'Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum?'</p>

<p>"Gray wrote but little, yet he wrote that little well. He might have
done far more for us; the same is true of most men, even of the
greatest. The possibilities of a life are always in advance of its
performance. But we cannot say that his life was a wasted one. Even
this little <i>Elegy</i> alone should go for much. For, suppose that he
had never written this, but instead had done much else in other ways,
according to his powers: that he had written many learned treatises;
that he had, with keen criticism, expounded and reconstructed Greek
classics; that he had, perchance, sat upon the woolsack, and laid
rich offerings at the feet of blind Justice;&mdash;taking the years
together, would it have been, on the whole, better for him or for us?
Would he have added so much to the sum of human happiness? He might
thus have made himself a power for a time, to be dethroned by some
new usurper in the realm of knowledge; now he is a power and a joy
forever to countless thousands."</p>
<br>

<p>Two manuscripts of the <i>Elegy</i>, in Gray's handwriting, still exist.
Both were bequeathed by the poet, together with his library, letters,
and many miscellaneous papers, to his friends the Rev. William Mason
and the Rev. James Browne, as joint literary executors. Mason
bequeathed the entire trust to Mr. Stonhewer. The latter, in making
his will, divided the legacy into two parts. The larger share went to
the Master and Fellows of Pembroke Hall. Among the papers, which are
still in the possession of the College, was found a copy of the
<i>Elegy</i>. An excellent fac-simile of this manuscript appears in
Mathias's edition of Gray, published in 1814. In referring to it
hereafter we shall designate it as the "Pembroke" MS.</p>

<p>The remaining portion of Gray's literary bequest, including the other
manuscript of the <i>Elegy</i>, was left by Mr. Stonhewer to his friend,
Mr. Bright. In 1845 Mr. Bright's sons sold the collection at auction.
The MS. of the <i>Elegy</i> was bought by Mr. Granville John Penn, of
Stoke Park, for <i>one hundred pounds</i>&mdash;the highest sum that had ever
been known to be paid for a single sheet of paper. In 1854 this
manuscript came again into the market, and was knocked down to Mr.
Robert Charles Wrightson, of Birmingham, for &pound;131. On the 29th
of May, 1875, it was once more offered for sale in London, and was
purchased by Sir William Fraser for &pound;230, or about $1150. A
photographic reproduction of it was published in London in 1862. For
convenience we shall refer to it as the "Wrightson" MS.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the Wrightson MS. is the original one,
and that the Pembroke MS. is a fair copy made from it by the poet.
The former contains a greater number of alterations, and varies more
from the printed text. It bears internal evidence of being the rough
draft, while the other represents a later stage of the poem. We will
give the variations of both from the present version.<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> For the readings of the Wrightson MS. we have had to
depend on Mason, Mitford, and other editors of the poem, and on the
article in the <i>North American Review</i>, already referred to. The
readings of the Pembroke MS. are taken from the engraved fac-simile
in Mathias's edition.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> The <i>Saturday Review</i> for June 19, 1875, has a long
article on the change made by Gray in this stanza, entitled, "A
Lesson from Gray's Elegy," from which we cull the following
paragraphs:</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>"Gray, having first of all put down the names of three Romans as
illustrations of his meaning, afterwards deliberately struck them out
and put the names of three Englishmen instead. This is a sign of a
change in the taste of the age, a change with which Gray himself had
a good deal to do. The deliberate wiping out of the names of Cato,
Tully, and Cæsar, to put in the names of Hampden, Milton, and
Cromwell, seems to us so obviously a change for the better that there
seems to be no room for any doubt about it. It is by no means certain
that Gray's own contemporaries would have thought the matter equally
clear. We suspect that to many people in his day it must have seemed
a daring novelty to draw illustrations from English history,
especially from parts of English history which, it must be
remembered, were then a great deal more recent than they are now. To
be sure, in choosing English illustrations, a poet of Gray's time was
in rather a hard strait. If he chose illustrations from the century
or two before his own time, he could only choose names which had
hardly got free from the strife of recent politics. If, in a poem of
the nature of the Elegy, he had drawn illustrations from earlier
times of English history, he would have found but few people in his
day likely to understand him....</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>"The change which Gray made in this well-known stanza is not only an
improvement in a particular poem, it is a sign of a general
improvement in taste. He wrote first according to the vicious taste
of an earlier time, and he then changed it according to his own
better taste. And of that better taste he was undoubtedly a prophet
to others. Gray's poetry must have done a great deal to open men's
eyes to the fact that they were Englishmen, and that on them, as
Englishmen, English things had a higher claim than Roman, and that to
them English examples ought to be more speaking than Roman ones. But
there is another side of the case not to be forgotten. Those who
would have regretted the change from Cato, Tully, and Cæsar to
Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell, those who perhaps really did think
that the bringing in of Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell was a
degradation of what they would have called the Muse, were certainly
not those who had the truest knowledge of Cato, Tully, and Cæsar. The
'classic' taste from which Gray helped to deliver us was a taste
which hardly deserves to be called a taste. Pardonable perhaps in the
first heat of the Renaissance, when 'classic' studies and objects had
the charm of novelty, it had become by his day a mere silly
fashion."</small></blockquote>

made from any objection to the stanza in itself, but simply because
it was too long a parenthesis in this place; on the principle which
he states in a letter to Dr. Beattie: "As to description, I have
always thought that it made the most graceful ornament of poetry, but
never ought to make the subject." The part was sacrificed for the

<p>Some of the peculiarities of spelling in this MS. are the following:

<p>Mitford, in his Life of Gray prefixed to the "Eton" edition of his
Poems (edited by Rev. John Moultrie, 1847), says: "I possess many
curious variations from the printed text, taken from a copy of it in
his own handwriting." He adds specimens of these variations, a few of
which differ from both the Wrightson and Pembroke MSS. We give these
in our notes below. See on <a href="#elegyl12">12</a>, <a href="#elegyl24">24</a>, and <a href="#elegyl93">93</a>.</p>
<br>

<p>Several localities have contended for the honor of being the scene of
the <i>Elegy</i>, but the general sentiment has always, and justly, been
in favor of Stoke-Pogis. It was there that Gray began the poem in
1742; and there, as we have seen, he finished it in 1750. In that
churchyard his mother was buried, and there, at his request, his own
remains were afterwards laid beside her. The scene is, moreover, in
all respects in perfect keeping with the spirit of the poem.</p>

<p>According to the common Cambridge tradition, Granchester, a parish
about two miles southwest of the University, to which Gray was in the
habit of taking his "constitutional" daily, is the locality of the
poem; and the great bell of St. Mary's is the "curfew" of the first
stanza. Another tradition makes a similar claim for Madingley, some
three miles and a half northwest of Cambridge. Both places have
churchyards such as the <i>Elegy</i> describes; and this is about all that
can be said in favor of their pretensions. There is also a parish
called Burnham Beeches, in Buckinghamshire, which one writer at least
has suggested as the scene of the poem, but for no better reason than
that Gray once wrote a description of the place to Walpole, and
casually mentioned the existence of certain "beeches," at the foot of
which he would "squat," and "there grow to the trunk a whole
morning." Gray's uncle had a seat in the neighborhood, and the poet
often visited here, but the spot was not hallowed to him by the fond
and tender associations that gathered about Stoke.</p>
<br>
<a name="elegyl1"></a>
<p><a href="#elegy1">1.</a> <i>The curfew</i>. Hales remarks: "It is a great mistake to suppose
that the ringing of the curfew was, at its institution, a mark of
Norman oppression. If such a custom was unknown before the Conquest,
it only shows that the old English police was less well-regulated
than that of many parts of the Continent, and how much the superior
civilization of the Norman-French was needed. Fires were the curse of
the timber-built towns of the Middle Ages: 'Solae pestes Londoniae
sunt stultorum immodica potatio et <i>frequens incendium</i>'
(Fitzstephen). The enforced extinction of domestic lights at an
appointed signal was designed to be a safeguard against them."</p>

<p>Warton wanted to have this line read</p>

<center><small>"The curfew tolls!&mdash;the knell of parting day."</small></center>

<p>It is sufficient to say that Gray, as the manuscript shows, did not
want it to read so, and that we much prefer his way to Warton's.</p>

<p>Mitford says that <i>toll</i> is "not the appropriate verb," as the curfew
was rung, not tolled. We presume that depended, to some extent, on
the fancy of the ringer. Milton (<i>Il Pens.</i> 76) speaks of the curfew
as</p>

<center><small>"Swinging slow with sullen roar."</small></center>

<p>Gray himself quotes here Dante, <i>Purgat.</i> 8:</p>

<center><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;"squilla di lontano<br>
Che paia 'l giorno pianger, che si muore;"</small></center>

<p>and we cannot refrain from adding, for the benefit of those
unfamiliar with Italian, Longfellow's exquisite translation:</p>

<center><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;"from far away a bell<br>
That seemeth to deplore the dying day."</small></center>

<p>Mitford quotes (incorrectly, as often) Dryden, <i>Prol. to Troilus and
Cressida</i>, 22:</p>

<center><small>"That tolls the knell for their departed sense."</small></center>

<p>On <i>parting</i>=departing, cf. Shakes. <i>Cor.</i> v. 6: "When I parted
hence;" Goldsmith, <i>D. V.</i> 171: "Beside the bed where parting life
was laid," etc.</p>
<a name="elegyl2"></a>
<p><a href="#elegy1">2.</a> <i>The lowing herd wind</i>, etc. <i>Wind</i>, and not <i>winds</i>, is the
reading of the MS. (see fac-simile of this stanza <a href="#ill34">above</a>) and of
<i>all</i> the early editions&mdash;that of 1768, Mason's, Wakefield's,
Mathias's, etc.&mdash;but we find no note of the fact in Mitford's or any
other of the more recent editions, which have substituted <i>winds</i>.
Whether the change was made as an amendment or accidentally, we do
not know;<small><small><sup>10</sup></small></small> but the original reading seems to us by far the better
one. The poet does not refer to the herd as an aggregate, but to the
animals that compose it. He sees, not <i>it</i>, but "<i>them</i> on their
winding way." The ordinary reading mars both the meaning and the
melody of the line.</p>
<a name="elegyfootnote10"></a>
<blockquote><small><small><sup>10</sup></small> Very likely the latter, as we have seen that <i>winds</i>
appears in the unauthorized version of the <i>London Magazine</i> (March,
1751), where it may be a misprint, like the others noted above.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>We may remark here that the edition of 1768&mdash;the <i>editio princeps</i> of
the <i>collected</i> Poems&mdash;was issued under Gray's own supervision, and
is printed with remarkable accuracy. We have detected only one
indubitable error of the type in the entire volume. Certain
peculiarities of spelling were probably intentional, as we find the
like in the fac-similes of the poet's manuscripts. The many
quotations from Greek, Latin, and Italian are correctly given
(according to the received texts of the time), and the references to
authorities, so far as we have verified them, are equally exact. The
book throughout bears the marks of Gray's scholarly and critical
habits, and we may be sure that the poems appear in precisely the
form which he meant they should retain. In doubtful cases, therefore,
we have generally followed this edition. Mason's (the <i>second</i>
edition: York, 1778) is also carefully edited and printed, and its
readings seldom vary from Gray's. All of Mitford's that we have
examined swarm with errors, especially in the notes. Pickering's
(1835), edited by Mitford, is perhaps the worst of all. The Boston
ed. (Little, Brown, &amp; Co., 1853) is a pretty careful reproduction of
Pickering's, with all its inaccuracies.</small></blockquote>

<p><a href="#elegy1">3.</a> The critic of the <i>N. A. Review</i> points out that this line "is
quite peculiar in its possible transformations. We have made," he
adds, "twenty different versions preserving the rhythm, the general
sentiment and the rhyming word. Any one of these variations might be,
not inappropriately, substituted for the original reading."</p>

<p>In Gray's time, and long before, and some time after it, the former
resting-place was for the poor, the latter for the rich. It was so in
the first instance, for two reasons: (i.) the interior of the church
was regarded as of great sanctity, and all who could sought a place
in it, the most dearly coveted spot being near the high altar; (ii.)
when elaborate tombs were the fashion, they were built inside the
church for the sake of security, 'gay tombs' being liable to be
'robb'd' (see the funeral dirge in Webster's <i>White Devil</i>). As these
two considerations gradually ceased to have power, and other
considerations of an opposite tendency began to prevail, the inside
of the church became comparatively deserted, except when ancestral
reasons gave no choice" (Hales).</p>

which Milton speaks in his noble sonnet to our 'chief of men' as in
his own day enveloping the great republican leader, still lay thick
and heavy over him. His wise statesmanship, his unceasing
earnestness, his high-minded purpose, were not yet seen."</p>

<p><a href="#elegy21">84.</a> <i>That teach</i>. Mitford censures <i>teach</i> as ungrammatical; but it
may be justified as a "construction according to sense."</p>

<p><a href="#elegy22">85.</a> Hales remarks: "At the first glance it might seem that <i>to dumb
Forgetfulness a prey</i> was in apposition to <i>who</i>, and the meaning
was, 'Who that now lies forgotten,' etc.; in which case the second
line of the stanza must be closely connected with the fourth; for the
question of the passage is not 'Who ever died?' but 'Who ever died
without wishing to be remembered?' But in this way of interpreting
this difficult stanza (i.) there is comparatively little force in the
appositional phrase, and (ii.) there is a certain awkwardness in
deferring so long the clause (virtually adverbal though apparently
coördinate) in which, as has just been noticed, the point of the
question really lies. Perhaps therefore it is better to take the
phrase <i>to dumb Forgetfulness a prey</i> as in fact the completion of
the predicate <i>resign'd</i>, and interpret thus: Who ever resigned this
life of his with all its pleasures and all its pains to be utterly
ignored and forgotten?=who ever, when resigning it, reconciled
himself to its being forgotten? In this case the second half of the
stanza echoes the thought of the first half."</p>

<p>We give the note in full, and leave the reader to take his choice of
the two interpretations. For ourself, we incline to the first rather
than the second. We prefer to take <i>to dumb Forgetfulness a prey</i> as
appositional and proleptic, and not as the grammatical complement of
<i>resigned:</i> Who, yielding himself up a prey to dumb Forgetfulness,
ever resigned this life without casting a longing, lingering look
behind?</p>

<p>"In this stanza," says Hales, "he answers in an exquisite manner the
two questions, or rather the one question twice repeated, of the
preceding stanza.... What he would say is that every one while a
spark of life yet remains in him yearns for some kindly loving
remembrance; nay, even after the spark is quenched, even when all is
dust and ashes, that yearning must still be felt."</p>

<p><a href="#elegy23">91, 92.</a> Mitford paraphrases the couplet thus: "The voice of Nature
still cries from the tomb in the language of the epitaph inscribed

fires of former affection are still alive beneath our ashes."</p>

<p>In <i>L'Allegro</i>, 92, we have "upland hamlets," where Hales thinks
"upland=country, as opposed to town." He adds, "Gray in his <i>Elegy</i>
seems to use the word loosely for 'on the higher ground;' perhaps he
took it from Milton, without quite understanding in what sense Milton
uses it." We doubt whether Hales understands Milton here. It is true
that <i>upland</i> used to mean country, as <i>uplanders</i> meant countrymen,
and <i>uplandish</i> countrified (see Nares and Wb.), but the other
meaning is older than Milton (see Halliwell's <i>Dict. of Archaic
Words</i>), and Johnson, Keightley, and others are probably right in
considering "upland hamlets" an instance of it. Masson, in his recent
edition of Milton (1875), explains the "upland hamlets" as "little
villages among the slopes, away from the river-meadows and the
hay-making."</p>

<p>Lucretius (i. 291) has "gremium matris terrai." Mitford adds the
pathetic sentence of Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> ii. 63: "Nam terra novissime
complexa gremio jam a reliqua natura abnegatos, tum maxime, ut mater,
operit."</p>
<a name="elegyl123"></a>
<p><a href="#elegy31">123.</a> <i>He gave to misery all he had, a tear</i>. This is the pointing of
the line in the MSS. and in all the early editions except that of
Mathias, who seems to be responsible for the change (adopted by the
recent editors, almost without exception) to,</p>

<center><small>"He gave to Misery (all he had) a tear."</small></center>

<p>This alters the meaning, mars the rhythm, and spoils the sentiment.
If one does not see the difference at once, it would be useless to
try to make him see it. Mitford, who ought to have known better, not
only thrusts in the parenthesis, but quotes this from Pope's Homer as
an illustration of it:</p>

<center><small>"His fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live."</small></center>

<p><a href="#elegy32">126.</a> Mitford says that <i>Or</i> in this line should be <i>Nor</i>. Yes, if
"draw" is an imperative, like "seek;" no, if it is an infinitive, in
the same construction as "to disclose." That the latter was the
construction the poet had in mind is evident from the form of the
stanza in the Wrightson MS., where "seek" is repeated:</p>

<h4>ODE ON THE SPRING.</h4>
<br>

<p>The original manuscript title of this ode was "Noontide." It was
first printed in Dodsley's <i>Collection</i>, vol. ii. p. 271, under the
title of "Ode."</p>

<p>The <i>Horæ</i>, or hours, according to the Homeric idea, were the
goddesses of the seasons, the course of which was symbolically
represented by "the dance of the Hours." They were often described,
in connection with the Graces, Hebe, and Aphrodite, as accompanying
with their dancing the songs of the Muses and the lyre of Apollo.
Long after the time of Homer they continued to be regarded as the
givers of the seasons, especially spring and autumn, or "Nature in
her bloom and her maturity." At first there were only two Horæ,
Thallo (or Spring) and Karpo (or Autumn); but later the number was
three, like that of the Graces. In art they are represented as
blooming maidens, bearing the products of the seasons.</p>

<p><a href="#spring1">2.</a> <i>Fair Venus' train</i>. The Hours adorned Aphrodite (Venus) as she
rose from the sea, and are often associated with her by Homer,
Hesiod, and other classical writers. Wakefield remarks: "Venus is
here employed, in conformity to the mythology of the Greeks, as the
source of creation and beauty."</p>

<p><a href="#spring1">3.</a> <i>Long-expecting</i>. Waiting long for the spring. Sometimes
incorrectly printed "long-expected." Cf. Dryden, <i>Astræa Redux</i>, 132:

Attica, was changed into a nightingale. Cf. Milton's description of

<p>According to Ruskin (<i>Modern Painters</i>, vol. iii. p. 241, Amer. ed.)
there is no brown in nature. After remarking that Dante "does not
acknowledge the existence of the colour of <i>brown</i> at all," he goes
on to say: "But one day, just when I was puzzling myself about this,
I happened to be sitting by one of our best living modern colourists,
watching him at his work, when he said, suddenly and by mere
accident, after we had been talking about other things, 'Do you know
I have found that there is no <i>brown</i> in nature? What we call brown
is always a variety either of orange or purple. It never can be
represented by umber, unless altered by contrast.' It is curious how
far the significance of this remark extends, how exquisitely it
illustrates and confirms the mediæval sense of hue," etc.</p>

practice of giving to adjectives derived from substantives the

Gray the <i>honied</i> spring." But, as we have seen, <i>honied</i> is found in
Milton; and Shakespeare also uses it in <i>Hen. V.</i> i. 1: "honey'd
sentences." <i>Mellitus</i> is used by Cicero, Horace, and Catullus. The
editor of an English dictionary, as Lord Grenville has remarked,

thought on which my second Ode turns [this Ode, afterwards placed
first by Gray] is manifestly stole from hence; not that I knew it at
the time, but having seen this many years before, to be sure it
imprinted itself on my memory, and, forgetting the Author, I took it

<h4>ODE ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE CAT.</h4>
<br>

<p>This ode first appeared in Dodsley's <i>Collection</i>, vol. ii. p. 274,
with some variations noticed below. Walpole, after the death of Gray,
placed the china vase on a pedestal at Strawberry Hill, with a few
lines of the ode for an inscription.</p>

<p>In a letter to Walpole, dated March 1, 1747, Gray refers to the
subject of the ode in the following jocose strain: "As one ought to
be particularly careful to avoid blunders in a compliment of
condolence, it would be a sensible satisfaction to me (before I
testify my sorrow, and the sincere part I take in your misfortune) to
know for certain who it is I lament. I knew Zara and Selima (Selima,
was it? or Fatima?), or rather I knew them both together; for I
cannot justly say which was which. Then as to your handsome Cat, the
name you distinguish her by, I am no less at a loss, as well knowing
one's handsome cat is always the cat one likes best; or if one be
alive and the other dead, it is usually the latter that is the
handsomest. Besides, if the point were never so clear, I hope you do
not think me so ill-bred or so imprudent as to forfeit all my
interest in the survivor; oh no! I would rather seem to mistake, and
imagine to be sure it must be the tabby one that had met with this
sad accident. Till this affair is a little better determined, you
will excuse me if I do not begin to cry,</p>

<center><small>Tempus inane peto, requiem spatiumque doloris.</small></center>

<p>"... Heigh ho! I feel (as you to be sure have done long since) that I
have very little to say, at least in prose. Somebody will be the
better for it; I do not mean you, but your Cat, feuë Mademoiselle
Selime, whom I am about to immortalize for one week or fortnight, as
follows: [the Ode follows, which we need not reprint here].</p>

<h4>ODE ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF ETON COLLEGE.</h4>
<br>

<p>This, as Mason informs us, was the first English<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> production of
Gray's that appeared in print. It was published, in folio, in 1747;
and appeared again in Dodsley's <i>Collection</i>, vol. ii. p. 267,
without the name of the author.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> A Latin poem by him, a "Hymeneal" on the Prince of
Wales's Marriage, had appeared in the <i>Cambridge Collection</i> in
1736.</small></blockquote>

<p>Hazlitt (<i>Lectures on English Poets</i>) says of this Ode: "It is more
mechanical and commonplace [than the <i>Elegy</i>]; but it touches on
certain strings about the heart, that vibrate in unison with it to
our latest breath. No one ever passes by Windsor's 'stately heights,'
or sees the distant spires of Eton College below, without thinking of
Gray. He deserves that we should think of him; for he thought of
others, and turned a trembling, ever-watchful ear to 'the still sad
music of humanity.'"</p>

<p>The writer in the <i>North American Review</i> (vol. xcvi.), after
referring to the publication of this Ode, which, "according to the
custom of the time, was judiciously swathed in folio," adds:</p>

<p>"About this time Gray's portrait was painted, at Walpole's request;
and on the paper which he is represented as holding, Walpole wrote
the title of the Ode, with a line from Lucan:</p>

<center><small>'Nec licuit populis parvum te, Nile, videre.'</small></center>

<p>The poem met with very little attention until it was republished in
1751, with a few other of his Odes. Gray, in speaking of it to
Walpole, in connection with the Ode to Spring, merely says that to
him 'the latter seems not worse than the former.' But the former has
always been the greater favourite&mdash;perhaps more from the matter than
the manner. It is the expression of the memories, the thoughts, and
the feelings which arise unbidden in the mind of the man as he looks
once more on the scenes of his boyhood. He feels a new youth in the
presence of those old joys. But the old friends are not there.
Generations have come and gone, and an unknown race now frolic in
boyish glee. His sad, prophetic eye cannot help looking into the
future, and comparing these careless joys with the inevitable ills of
life. Already he sees the fury passions in wait for their little
victims. They seem present to him, like very demons. Our language
contains no finer, more graphic personifications than these almost
tangible shapes. Spenser is more circumstantial, Collins more
vehement, but neither is more real. Though but outlines in miniature,
they are as distinct as Dutch art. Every epithet is a lifelike
picture; not a word could be changed without destroying the tone of
the whole. At last the musing poet asks himself, <i>Cui bono?</i> Why thus
borrow trouble from the future? Why summon so soon the coming
locusts, to poison before their time the glad waters of youth?</p>

<p>So feeling and the want of feeling come together for once in the
moral. The gay Roman satirist&mdash;the apostle of indifferentism&mdash;reaches

weaker prepositions was not allowed, except in the compounds

the longer forms were still, though rarely, transposed (see <i>Shakes.

whose fatal power the brief sunshine of youth is supposed to be
exempt. The fields are <i>beloved</i> as the scene of youthful pleasures,
and as affording the promise of happiness to come; but this promise
never was fulfilled. Fate, which dooms man to misery, soon
overclouded these opening prospects of delight. That is in vain
beloved which does not realize the expectations it held out. No fruit

hope."</p>

<h4>THE PROGRESS OF POESY.</h4>
<br>

<p>This Ode, as we learn from one of Gray's letters to Walpole, was
finished, with the exception of a few lines, in 1755. It was not
published until 1757, when it appeared with <i>The Bard</i> in a quarto
volume, which was the first issue of Walpole's press at Strawberry
Hill. In one of his letters Walpole writes: "I send you two copies of
a very honourable opening of my press&mdash;two amazing odes of Mr. Gray.
They are Greek, they are Pindaric, they are sublime, consequently I
fear a little obscure; the second particularly, by the confinement of
the measure and the nature of prophetic vision, is mysterious. I
could not persuade him to add more notes." In another letter Walpole
says: "I found Gray in town last week; he had brought his two odes to
be printed. I snatched them out of Dodsley's hands, and they are to
be the first-fruits of my press." The title-page of the volume is as
follows:</p>

<center>ODES<br>
<small><small>BY</small></small><br>
M<small>R</small>. GRAY.<br>
[Greek:  PHÔNANTA SUNETOISI]&mdash;P<small>INDAR</small>, Olymp, II.<br>
PRINTED <small>AT</small> STRAWBERRY-HILL,<br>
for R. and J. D<small>ODSLEY</small> in Pall-Mall.<br>
MDCCLVII.</center>

<p>Both Odes were coldly received at first. "Even my friends," writes
Gray, in a letter to Hurd, Aug. 25, 1757, "tell me they do not
<i>succeed</i>, and write me moving topics of consolation on that head. In
short, I have heard of nobody but an Actor [Garrick] and a Doctor of
Divinity [Warburton] that profess their esteem for them. Oh yes, a
Lady of quality (a friend of Mason's) who is a great reader. She knew
there was a compliment to Dryden, but never suspected there was
anything said about Shakespeare or Milton, till it was explained to
her, and wishes that there had been titles prefixed to tell what they
were about."<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> In a letter to Dr. Wharton, dated Aug. 17, 1757, he
says: "I hear we are not at all popular. The great objection is
obscurity, nobody knows what we would be at. One man (a Peer) I have
been told of, that thinks the last stanza of the 2d Ode relates to
Charles the First and Oliver Cromwell; in short, the [Greek: Sunetoi]
appear to be still fewer than even I expected." A writer in the
<i>Critical Review</i> thought that "Æolian lyre" meant the Æolian harp.
Coleman the elder and Robert Lloyd wrote parodies entitled Odes to
Obscurity and Oblivion. Gray finally had to add explanatory notes,
though he intimates that his readers ought not to have needed
them.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Forster remarks that Gray might have added to the
admirers of the Odes "the poor monthly critic of <i>The
Dunciad</i>"&mdash;Oliver Goldsmith, then beginning his London career as a
bookseller's hack. In a review of the Odes in the <i>London Monthly
Review</i> for Sept., 1757, after citing certain passages of <i>The Bard</i>,
he says that they "will give as much pleasure to those who relish
this species of composition as anything that has hitherto appeared in
our language, the odes of Dryden himself not excepted."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> In a foot-note he says: "When the author first published
this and the following Ode, he was advised, even by his friends, to
subjoin some few explanatory notes; but had too much respect for the
understanding of his readers to take that liberty."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>In a letter to Beattie, dated Feb. 1, 1768, referring to the new
edition of his poems, he says: "As to the notes, I do it out of
spite, because the public did not understand the two Odes (which I
have called Pindaric), though the first was not very dark, and the
second alluded to a few common facts to be found in any sixpenny
history of England, by way of question and answer, for the use of
children." And in a letter to Walpole, Feb. 25, 1768, he says he has
added "certain little Notes, partly from justice (to acknowledge the
debt where I had borrowed anything), partly from ill temper, just to
tell the gentle reader that Edward I. was not Oliver Cromwell, nor
Queen Elizabeth the Witch of Endor."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>Mr. Fox, afterwards Lord Holland, said that "if the Bard recited his
Ode only <i>once</i> to Edward, he was sure he could not understand it."
When this was told to Gray, he said, "If he had recited it twenty
times, Edward would not have been a bit wiser; but that was no reason
why Mr. Fox should not."</small></blockquote>

<p>"The metre of these Odes is constructed on Greek models. It is not
uniform but symmetrical. The nine stanzas of each ode form three
groups. A slight examination will show that the 1st, 4th, and 7th
stanzas are exactly inter-correspondent; so the 2d, 5th, and 8th; and
so the remaining three. The technical Greek names for these three
parts were [Greek: strophê] (strophe), [Greek: antistrophê]
(antistrophe), and [Greek: epôdos] (epodos)&mdash;the Turn, the
Counter-turn, and the After-song&mdash;names derived from the theatre; the
Turn denoting the movement of the Chorus from one side of the [Greek:
orchêstra] (orchestra), or Dance-stage, to the other, the
Counter-turn the reverse movement, the After-song something sung
after two such movements. Odes thus constructed were called by the
Greeks Epodic. Congreve is said to have been the first who so
constructed English odes. This system cannot be said to have
prospered with us. Perhaps no English ear would instinctively
recognize that correspondence between distant parts which is the

<p><a href="#poesy1">1.</a> <i>Awake, Æolian lyre</i>. The blunder of the Critical Reviewers who
supposed the "harp of Æolus" to be meant led Gray to insert this
note: "Pindar styles his own poetry with its musical accompaniments,
[Greek: Aiolis molpê, Aiolides chordai, Aiolidôn pnoai aulôn], Æolian
song, Æolian strings, the breath of the Æolian flute."</p>

<p>Cf. Cowley, <i>Ode of David:</i> "Awake, awake, my lyre!" Gray himself
quotes <i>Ps.</i> lvii. 8. The first reading of the line in the MS. was,
"Awake, my lyre: my glory, wake." Gray also adds the following note:
"The subject and simile, as usual with Pindar, are united. The
various sources of poetry, which gives life and lustre to all it
touches, are here described; its quiet majestic progress enriching
every subject (otherwise dry and barren) with a pomp of diction and
luxuriant harmony of numbers; and its more rapid and irresistible
course, when swollen and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous
passions."</p>

is old or old-fashioned and what is odd, fantastic, or grotesque is
obvious enough. Cf. Milton, <i>Il Pens.</i> 158: "With antick pillars

<p>We append, as a curiosity of criticism, Dr. Johnson's comments on
this ode, from his <i>Lives of the Poets</i>. The Life of Gray has been
called "the worst in the series," and perhaps this is the worst part
of it:<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small></p>

<p>"My process has now brought me to the <i>wonderful</i> 'Wonder of
Wonders,' the two Sister Odes, by which, though either vulgar
ignorance or common-sense at first universally rejected them, many
have been since persuaded to think themselves delighted. I am one of
those that are willing to be pleased, and therefore would gladly find
the meaning of the <a href="#poesy1">first stanza</a> of 'The Progress of Poetry.'</p>

<p>"Gray seems in his rapture to confound the images of spreading sound
and running water. A 'stream of music' may be allowed; but where does
'music,' however 'smooth and strong,' after having visited the
'verdant vales, roll down the steep amain,' so as that 'rocks and
nodding groves rebellow to the roar?' If this be said of music, it is
nonsense; if it be said of water, it is nothing to the purpose.</p>

<p>"The <a href="#poesy2">second stanza</a>, exhibiting Mars's car and Jove's eagle, is
unworthy of further notice. Criticism disdains to chase a schoolboy
to his commonplaces.</p>

<p>"To the <a href="#poesy3">third</a> it may likewise be objected that it is drawn from
mythology, though such as may be more easily assimilated to real
life. Idalia's 'velvet-green' has something of cant. An epithet or
metaphor drawn from Nature ennobles Art; an epithet or metaphor drawn
from Art degrades Nature. Gray is too fond of words arbitrarily
compounded. 'Many-twinkling' was formerly censured as not analogical;
we may say 'many-spotted,' but scarcely 'many-spotting.' This stanza,
however, has something pleasing.</p>

<p>"Of the second ternary of stanzas, the <a href="#poesy4">first</a> endeavours to tell
something, and would have told it, had it not been crossed by
Hyperion; the <a href="#poesy5">second</a> describes well enough the universal prevalence
of poetry; but I am afraid that the conclusion will not arise from
the premises. The caverns of the North and the plains of Chili are
not the residences of 'Glory and generous Shame.' But that Poetry and
Virtue go always together is an opinion so pleasing that I can
forgive him who resolves to think it true.</p>

<p>"The <a href="#poesy6">third stanza</a> sounds big with 'Delphi,' and 'Ægean,' and
'Ilissus,' and 'Mæander,' and with 'hallowed fountains,' and 'solemn
sound;' but in all Gray's odes there is a kind of cumbrous splendour
which we wish away. His position is at last false: in the time of
Dante and Petrarch, from whom we derive our first school of poetry,
Italy was overrun by 'tyrant power' and 'coward vice;' nor was our
state much better when we first borrowed the Italian arts.</p>

<p>"Of the third ternary, the <a href="#poesy7">first</a> gives a mythological birth of
Shakespeare. What is said of that mighty genius is true; but it is
not said happily: the real effects of this poetical power are put out
of sight by the pomp of machinery. Where truth is sufficient to fill
the mind, fiction is worse than useless; the counterfeit debases the
genuine.</p>

<p>"His account of Milton's blindness, if we suppose it caused by study
in the formation of his poem, a supposition surely allowable, is
poetically true and happily imagined. But the <i>car</i> of Dryden, with
his <i>two coursers</i>, has nothing in it peculiar; it is a car in which
any other rider may be placed."</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> Sir James Mackintosh well says of Johnson's criticisms:
"Wherever understanding alone is sufficient for poetical criticism,
the decisions of Johnson are generally right. But the beauties of
poetry must be <i>felt</i> before their causes are investigated. There is
a poetical sensibility, which in the progress of the mind becomes as
distinct a power as a musical ear or a picturesque eye. Without a
considerable degree of this sensibility, it is as vain for a man of
the greatest understanding to speak of the higher beauties of poetry
as it is for a blind man to speak of colours. To adopt the warmest
sentiments of poetry, to realize its boldest imagery, to yield to
every impulse of enthusiasm, to submit to the illusions of fancy, to
retire with the poet into his ideal worlds, were dispositions wholly
foreign from the worldly sagacity and stern shrewdness of Johnson. As
in his judgment of life and character, so in his criticism on poetry,
he was a sort of Free-thinker. He suspected the refined of
affectation, he rejected the enthusiastic as absurd, and he took it
for granted that the mysterious was unintelligible. He came into the
world when the school of Dryden and Pope gave the law to English
poetry. In that school he had himself learned to be a lofty and
vigorous declaimer in harmonious verse; beyond that school his
unforced admiration perhaps scarcely soared; and his highest effort
of criticism was accordingly the noble panegyric on Dryden."</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>W. H. Prescott, the historian, also remarks that Johnson, as a
critic, "was certainly deficient in sensibility to the more delicate,
the minor beauties of poetic sentiment. He analyzes verse in the
cold-blooded spirit of a chemist, until all the aroma which
constituted its principal charm escapes in the decomposition. By this
kind of process, some of the finest fancies of the Muse, the lofty
dithyrambics of Gray, the ethereal effusions of Collins, and of
Milton too, are rendered sufficiently vapid."</small></blockquote>

<h4>THE BARD.</h4>
<br>

<p>"This ode is founded on a tradition current in Wales that Edward the
First, when he completed the conquest of that country, ordered all
the bards that fell into his hands to be put to death" (Gray).</p>

<p>The original argument of the ode, as Gray had set it down in his
commonplace-book, was as follows: "The army of Edward I., as they
march through a deep valley, and approach Mount Snowdon, are suddenly
stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the summit
of an inaccessible rock, who, with a voice more than human,
reproaches the king with all the desolation and misery which he had
brought on his country; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race,
and with prophetic spirit declares that all his cruelty shall never
extinguish the noble ardour of poetic genius in this island; and that
men shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valour in
immortal strains, to expose vice and infamous pleasure, and boldly
censure tyranny and oppression. His song ended, he precipitates
himself from the mountain, and is swallowed up by the river that
rolls at its feet."</p>

<p>Mitford, in his "Essay on the Poetry of Gray," says of this Ode: "The
tendency of <i>The Bard</i> is to show the retributive justice that
follows an act of tyranny and wickedness; to denounce on Edward, in
his person and his progeny, the effect of the crime he had committed
in the massacre of the bards; to convince him that neither his power
nor situation could save him from the natural and necessary
consequences of his guilt; that not even the virtues which he
possessed could atone for the vices with which they were accompanied:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem144">
	<tr><td><small>'Helm nor hauberk's twisted mail,<br>
		&nbsp;Nor e'en thy <i>virtues</i>, tyrant, shall avail.'</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This is the real tendency of the poem; and well worthy it was of
being adorned and heightened by such a profusion of splendid images
and beautiful machinery. We must also observe how much this moral
feeling increases as we approach the close; how the poem rises in
dignity; and by what a fine gradation the solemnity of the subject
ascends. The Bard commenced his song with feelings of sorrow for his
departed brethren and his desolate country. This despondence,
however, has given way to emotions of a nobler and more exalted
nature. What can be more magnificent than the vision which opens
before him to display the triumph of justice and the final glory of
his cause? And it may be added, what can be more forcible or emphatic
than the language in which it is conveyed?</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem145">
	<tr><td><small>'But oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll?<br>
		&nbsp;Visions of glory, spare my aching sight!<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!</i>'</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The fine apostrophe to the shade of Taliessin completes the picture
of exultation:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem146">
	<tr><td><small>'Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.'</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The triumph of justice, therefore, is now complete. The vanquished
has risen superior to his conqueror, and the reader closes the poem
with feelings of content and satisfaction. He has seen the Bard
uplifted both by a divine energy and by the natural superiority of
virtue; and the conqueror has shrunk into a creature of hatred and
abhorrence:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem147">
	<tr><td><small>'Be thine despair, and sceptred care;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To triumph, and to die, are mine.'"</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>With regard to the <i>obscurity</i> of the poem, the same writer remarks
that "it is such only as of necessity arises from the plan and
conduct of a prophecy." "In the prophetic poem," he adds, "one point
of history alone is told, and the rest is to be acquired previously
by the reader; as in the contemplation of an historical picture,
which commands only one moment of time, our memory must supply us
with the necessary links of knowledge; and that point of time
selected by the painter must be illustrated by the spectator's
knowledge of the past or future, of the cause or the consequences."</p>

<p>He refers, for corroboration of this opinion, to Dr. Campbell, who in
his "Philosophy of Rhetoric," says: "I know no style to which
darkness of a certain sort is more suited than to the prophetical:
many reasons might be assigned which render it improper that prophecy
should be perfectly understood before it be accomplished. Besides, we
are certain that a prediction may be very dark before the
accomplishment, and yet so plain afterwards as scarcely to admit a
doubt in regard to the events suggested. It does not belong to
critics to give laws to prophets, nor does it fall within the
confines of any human art to lay down rules for a species of
composition so far above art. Thus far, however, we may warrantably
observe, that when the prophetic style is imitated in poetry, the
piece ought, as much as possible, to possess the character above
mentioned. This character, in my opinion, is possessed in a very
eminent degree by Mr. Gray's ode called <i>The Bard</i>. It is all
darkness to one who knows nothing of the English history posterior to
the reign of Edward the First, and all light to one who is acquainted
with that history. But this is a kind of writing whose peculiarities
can scarcely be considered as exceptions from ordinary rules."</p>

<p>Farther on in the same essay, Mitford remarks: "The skill of Gray is,
I think, eminently shown in the superior distinctness with which he
has marked those parts of his prophecies which are speedily to be
accomplished; and in the gradations by which, as he descends, he has
insensibly melted the more remote into the deeper and deeper
shadowings of general language. The first prophecy is the fate of
Edward the Second. In that the Bard has pointed out the very night in
which he is to be destroyed; has named the river that flowed around
his prison, and the castle that was the scene of his sufferings:</p>

<p>Hales remarks: "It is perhaps scarcely now necessary to say that the
tradition on which <i>The Bard</i> is founded is wholly groundless. Edward
I. never did massacre Welsh bards. Their name is legion in the
beginning of the 14th century. Miss Williams, the latest historian of
Wales, does not even mention the old story."<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> The <i>Saturday Review</i>, for June 19, 1875, in the article
from which we have elsewhere quoted (see <a href="#elegyfootnote4">above</a>, foot-note), refers to
this point as follows:<br>
<br>
"Gray was one of the first writers to show that earlier parts of
English history were not only worth attending to, but were capable of
poetic treatment. We can almost forgive him for dressing up in his
splendid verse a foul and baseless calumny against Edward the First,
when we remember that to most of Gray's contemporaries Edward the
First must have seemed a person almost mythical, a benighted Popish
savage, of whom there was very little to know, and that little hardly
worth knowing. Our feeling towards Gray in this matter is much the
same as our feeling towards Mitford in the matter of Greek history.
We are angry with Mitford for misrepresenting Demosthenes and a crowd
of other Athenian worthies, but we do not forget that he was the
first to deal with Demosthenes and his fellows, neither as mere names
nor as demi-gods, but as real living men like ourselves. It was a
pity to misrepresent Demosthenes, but even the misrepresentation was
something; it showed that Demosthenes could be made the subject of
human feeling one way or another. It is unpleasant to hear the King
whose praise it was that</small></blockquote>

<center><small>'Velox est ad veniam, ad vindictam tardus,'</small></center>

<blockquote><small>spoken of as 'ruthless,' and the rest of it. But Gray at least felt
that Edward was a real man, while to most of his contemporaries he
could have been little more than 'the figure of an old Gothic king,'
such as Sir Roger de Coverley looked when he sat in Edward's own
chair."</small></blockquote>

<p><a href="#bard1">11.</a> "Snowdon was a name given by the Saxons to that mountainous tract
which the Welsh themselves call <i>Craigian-eryri:</i> it included all the
highlands of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire, as far east as the
river Conway. R. Hygden, speaking of the castle of Conway, built by
King Edward the First, says: 'Ad ortum amnis Conway ad clivum montis
Erery;' and Matthew of Westminster (ad ann. 1283), 'Apud Aberconway
ad pedes montis Snowdoniae fecit erigi castrum forte'" (Gray).</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1283 that English troops at last forced their
way among the defiles of Snowdon. Llewellyn had preserved those
passes and heights intact until his death in the preceding December.
The surrender of Dolbadern in the April following that dispiriting
event opened a way for the invader; and William de Beauchamp, Earl of
Warwick, at once advanced by it (Hales).</p>

<p>The epithet <i>shaggy</i> is highly appropriate, as Leland (<i>Itin.</i>) says
that great woods clothed the mountain in his time. Cf. Dyer, <i>Ruins

<p><a href="#bard2">15.</a> <i>On a rock whose haughty brow</i>. Cf. Daniel, <i>Civil Wars:</i> "A huge
aspiring rock, whose surly brow."</p>

<p>The <i>rock</i> is probably meant for Penmaen-mawr, the northern
termination of the Snowdon range. It is a mass of rock, 1545 feet
high, a few miles from the mouth of the Conway, the valley of which
it overlooks. Towards the sea it presents a rugged and almost
perpendicular front. On its summit is Braich-y-Dinas, an ancient
fortified post, regarded as the strongest hold of the Britons in the
district of Snowdon. Here the reduced bands of the Welsh army were
stationed during the negotiation between their prince Llewellyn and
Edward I. Within the inner enclosure is a never-failing well of pure
water. The rock is now pierced with a tunnel 1890 feet long for the
Chester and Holyhead railway.</p>

<p><a href="#bard2">17.</a> <i>Rob'd in the sable garb of woe</i>. It would appear that Wharton
had criticised this line, for in a letter to him, dated Aug. 21,
1757, Gray writes: "You may alter that '<i>Robed in</i> the sable,' etc.,

<p>Though <i>haggard</i>, which conveys to you the idea of a <i>witch</i>, is
indeed only a metaphor taken from an unreclaimed hawk, which is
called a <i>haggard</i>, and looks wild and <i>farouche</i>, and jealous of its

think better) reading.</p>

<p><a href="#bard2">28.</a> Hoel is called <i>high-born</i>, being the son of Owen Gwynedd, prince
of North Wales, by Finnog, an Irish damsel. He was one of his
father's generals in his wars against the English, Flemings, and
Normans, in South Wales; and was a famous bard, as his poems that are
extant testify.</p>

<p><i>Soft Llewellyn's lay</i>. "The lay celebrating the mild Llewellyn,"
says Hales, though he afterwards remarks that, "looking at the
context, it would be better to take <i>Llewellyn</i> here for a bard."
Many bards celebrated the warlike prowess and princely qualities of
Llewellyn. A poem by Einion the son of Guigan calls him "a
tender-hearted prince;" and another, by Llywarch Brydydd y Moch,
says: "Llewellyn, though in battle he killed with fury, though he
burned like an outrageous fire, yet was a mild prince when the
mead-horns were distributed." In an ode by Llygard Gwr he is also
called "Llewellyn the mild."</p>

2463 feet in height. It is really a group of mountains, three of
which tower high above the others, and on each of these is a

divided into two peaks, and on these, as well as on another prominent
part of the same height, are other piles of stones. These five piles,
according to the common tradition, mark the graves of slain warriors,
and serve as memorials of their exploits; but some believe that they
were intended as landmarks or military signals, and that from them
the mountain was called <i>Pump-lumon</i> or <i>Pum-lumon</i>, "the five
beacons"&mdash;a name somehow corrupted into <i>Plinlimmon</i>. Five rivers

The 1st ed. and that of 1768 have "roofs;" the modern eds. "roof."</p>

<p>Berkeley Castle is on the southeast side of the town of Berkeley, on
a height commanding a fine view of the Severn and the surrounding
country, and is in a state of perfect preservation. It is said to
have been founded by Roger de Berkeley soon after the Norman
Conquest. About the year 1150 it was granted by Henry II. to Robert
Fitzhardinge, Governor of Bristol, who strengthened and enlarged it.
On the right of the great staircase leading to the keep, and
approached by a gallery, is the room in which it is supposed that
Edward II. was murdered, Sept. 21, 1327. The king, during his
captivity here, composed a dolorous poem, of which the following is
an extract:</p>

<p>As we have given Johnson's criticism on <i>The Progress of Poesy</i>, we
append his comments on this "Sister Ode:"</p>

<p>"'The Bard' appears, at the first view, to be, as Algarotti and
others have remarked, an imitation of the prophecy of Nereus.
Algarotti thinks it superior to its original; and, if preference
depends only on the imagery and animation of the two poems, his
judgment is right. There is in 'The Bard' more force, more thought,
and more variety. But to copy is less than to invent, and the copy
has been unhappily produced at a wrong time. The fiction of Horace
was to the Romans credible; but its revival disgusts us with apparent
and unconquerable falsehood. <i>Incredulus odi</i>.</p>

<p>"To select a singular event, and swell it to a giant's bulk by
fabulous appendages of spectres and predictions, has little
difficulty; for he that forsakes the probable may always find the
marvellous. And it has little use; we are affected only as we
believe; we are improved only as we find something to be imitated or
declined. I do not see that 'The Bard' promotes any truth, moral or
political.</p>

<p>"His stanzas are too long, especially his epodes; the ode is finished
before the ear has learned its measures, and consequently before it
can receive pleasure from their consonance and recurrence.</p>

<p>"Of the <a href="#bard1">first stanza</a> the abrupt beginning has been celebrated; but
technical beauties can give praise only to the inventor. It is in the
power of any man to rush abruptly upon his subject, that has read the
ballad of 'Johnny Armstrong,'</p>

<center><small>'Is there ever a man in all Scotland&mdash;'</small></center>

<p>"The initial resemblances, or alliterations, 'ruin, ruthless, helm or
hauberk,' are below the grandeur of a poem that endeavours at
sublimity.</p>

<p>"In the <a href="#bard2">second stanza</a> the Bard is well described; but in the <a href="#bard3">third</a> we
have the puerilities of obsolete mythology. When we are told that
'Cadwallo hush'd the stormy main,' and that 'Modred made huge
Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head,' attention recoils from the
repetition of a tale that, even when it was first heard, was heard
with scorn.</p>

<p>"The <a href="#bard4"><i>weaving</i></a> of the <i>winding-sheet</i> he borrowed, as he owns, from
the Northern Bards; but their texture, however, was very properly the
work of female powers, as the act of spinning the thread of life is
another mythology. Theft is always dangerous; Gray has made weavers
of slaughtered bards by a fiction outrageous and incongruous. They
are then called upon to 'Weave the warp, and weave the woof,' perhaps
with no great propriety; for it is by crossing the <i>woof</i> with the
<i>warp</i> that men weave the <i>web</i> or piece; and the first line was
dearly bought by the admission of its wretched correspondent, 'Give
ample room and verge enough.' He has, however, no other line as bad.</p>

<p>"The <a href="#bard6">third stanza</a> of the second ternary is commended, I think, beyond
its merit. The personification is indistinct. <i>Thirst</i> and <i>Hunger</i>
are not alike; and their features, to make the imagery perfect,
should have been discriminated. We are told, in the same stanza, how
'towers are fed.' But I will no longer look for particular faults;
yet let it be observed that the ode might have been concluded with an
action of better example; but suicide is always to be had, without
expense of thought."</p>

<h4>HYMN TO ADVERSITY.</h4>

<p>This poem first appeared in Dodsley's <i>Collection</i>, vol. iv.,

edition of the poems (1768) in the form given in the text. The best
modern editions of Æschylus have the reading, [Greek: ton (some, tôi)
pathei mathos]. Keck translates the passage into German thus:</p>

<h3>APPENDIX TO NOTES.</h3>
<hr align="center" width="100">
<br>

<p>Just as this book is going to press we have received <i>The Quarterly
Review</i> (London) for January, 1876, which contains an interesting
paper on "Wordsworth and Gray." After quoting Wordsworth's remark
that "Gray was at the head of those poets who, by their reasonings,
have attempted to widen the space of separation between prose and
metrical composition, and was, more than any other man, curiously
elaborate in the construction of his own poetic diction," the
reviewer remarks:</p>

<p>"The indictment, then, brought by Wordsworth against Gray is twofold.
Gray, it seems, had in the first place a false conception of the
nature of poetry; and, secondly, a false standard of poetical
diction. To begin with the first count, Gray, we are told, sought to
widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition.
What this charge amounts to we shall see hereafter. Meantime, did
Wordsworth think that between prose and poetry there was any line of
demarcation at all? In the Preface [to the "Lyrical Ballads"] from
which we have quoted we read:</p>

<p>"'There neither is nor can be any essential difference between the
language of prose and metrical composition. We are fond of tracing
the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and accordingly we call
them sisters; but where shall we find bonds of connection
sufficiently strong to typify the connection betwixt prose and
metrical composition?'</p>

<p>"Now this question admits of a very definite answer. Take the Iliad
of Homer and a proposition of Euclid. Is it conceivable that the
latter could have been expressed at all in metre, or the former
expressed half so well in prose? If not, what is the reason? Is it
not plain that the poem contains a predominant element of imagination
and feeling which is absolutely excluded from the proposition? And in
the same way it may be shown that whenever a man expresses himself
properly in metre, the subject-matter of his composition belongs to
imagination or feeling; whenever he writes in prose his subject
belongs to or (if the prose be fiction) intimately resembles matter
of fact. We may decide then with certainty that the sphere of poetry
lies in Imagination, and that the larger the amount of <i>just</i> liberty
the Imagination enjoys, the better will be the poetry it produces.
But then a further question arises, and this is the key of the whole
position, How far does this liberty extend? Is Imagination absolute,
supreme, and uncontrolled in its own sphere, or is it under the
guidance and government of reason? That its dominion is not universal
is obvious, but of its influence we are all conscious, and there is
no exaggeration in the eloquent words of Pascal:</p>

<p>"'This mighty power, the perpetual antagonist of reason, which
delights to show its ascendency by bringing her under its control and
dominion, has created a second nature in man. It has its joys and its
sorrows; its health, its sickness; its wealth, its poverty; it
compels reason, in spite of herself, to believe, to doubt, to deny;
it suspends the exercise of the senses, and imparts to them again an
artificial acuteness; it has its follies and its wisdom; and the most
perverse thing of all is that it fills its votaries with a
complacency more full and complete even than that which reason can
supply.'</p>

<p>"If such be the force of Imagination in active life, how absolute
must be its dominion in poetry! And absolute it is, if we are to
believe Wordsworth, who defines poetry to be 'the spontaneous
overflow of powerful emotion.' This definition coincides well with
modern notions on the nature of the art. But how different is the
view if we turn from theory to practice! It would surely be a serious
mistake to describe the noblest poems, like the 'Æneid' or 'Paradise
Lost,' as the product of mere spontaneous emotion. And even in lyric
verse, to which it may be said Wordsworth is specially alluding, we
find the greatest poets, like Pindar and Simonides, composing their
odes for set occasions like the public games, in honour of persons
with whom they were but little acquainted, and (most significant fact
of all) in the expectation of receiving liberal rewards. We need not
say that such considerations detract nothing from the genius of these
great poets; but they prove very conclusively that poetry is not what
Wordsworth's definition asserts, and what in these days it is too
often assumed to be, the mere gush of unconscious inspiration. The
definition of Wordsworth may perhaps suit short lyrics, such as he
was himself in the habit of composing, but it would be fatal to the
claims of poetry to rank among the higher arts, for it would exclude
that quality which, in poetry as in all art, is truly sovereign,
Invention. The poet, no less than the mechanical inventor, excels by
the exercise of reason, by his knowledge of the required effect, his
power of adapting means to ends, and his skill in availing himself of
circumstances. Consider for a moment the external difficulties which
restrict the poet's liberty, and require the most vigorous efforts of
reason to subdue them. To begin with, in order to secure the happy
result promised by Horace,</p>

<p>he has to take the exact measure of his own powers. How many a poet
has failed for want of judgment by trespassing on a subject and style
for which his genius is unfitted! Again, he is confronted by the most
obvious difficulties of language and metre, which limit his freedom
to a degree unknown to the prose-writer. And beyond this, if he
wishes to be read&mdash;and a poem without readers is no more than a
musical instrument without a musician&mdash;he has to consider the
character of his audience. He must have all the instinct of an
orator, all the intuitive knowledge of the world, as well as all the
practical resource, which are required to gain command over the
hearts of men, and to subdue, by the charms of eloquence, their
passions, their prejudices, and their judgment. To achieve such
results something more is required than 'the spontaneous overflow of
powerful feeling.'</p>

<p>"How far Wordsworth's own poetry illustrates his principles we shall
consider presently; meantime his definition helps us to understand
what he meant by Gray's fault of widening the space of separation
betwixt prose and metrical composition. Neither in respect of the
quantity nor the quality of his verse could Gray's manner of
composition be described as spontaneous. Compared with Wordsworth's
numerous volumes of poetry, the slender volume that contains the
poetry of Gray looks meagre indeed; yet almost every poem in this
small collection is a considered work of art. To begin with 'The
Bard.' Few readers, we suppose, would rise from this ode without a
sense of its poetical 'effect.' The details may be thought to require
too much attention; the allusions, from the nature of the subject,
are, no doubt, difficult; but a feeling of loftiness, of harmony, of
proportion, remains in the mind at the close of the poem, which is
not likely to pass away. How, then, was this effect produced? First
of all we see that Gray had selected a good subject; his raw
materials, so to speak, were poetical. The imagination, unembarrassed
by common associations, breathes freely in its own region, and is
instinctively elevated as it moves among the great events of the
past, dwelling on the misfortunes of monarchs, the rise of dynasties,
and the splendours of literature. But, in the second place, when he
has chosen his subject, it is the part of the poet to impress the
great ideas derived from it on the feelings and the memory by the
distinctness of the form under which he presents it; and here
poetical invention first begins to work. By the imaginative fiction
of 'The Bard,' Gray is enabled to cast the whole course of English
history into the form of a prophecy, and to excite the patriotic
feelings of the reader, as Virgil roused the pride of his own
countrymen by Anchises' forecast of the grandeur of Rome. Finally,
when the main design of the poem is thus conceived, observe with what
art all the different parts are made to emphasize the beauty of the
general conception; with what dramatic propriety the calamities of
the conquering Plantagenet are prophesied by his vanquished foe;
while on the other hand, the literary glories of the Tudor Elizabeth
awaken the triumph of the patriot and the poet; how martial and
spirited is the opening of the poem! how lofty and enthusiastic its
close! Perhaps there is no English lyric which, animated by equal
fervour, displays so much architectural genius as 'The Bard.'</p>

<p>"Take, again, the 'Ode on the Prospect of Eton College.' A subject
better adapted far the indulgence of personal feeling, or for those
sentimental confidences between the reader and the poet, in which the
modern muse so much delights, could not be imagined. But what do we
find? The theme is treated in the most general manner. Though
emphasizing the irony of his reflection by the beautiful touch of
memory in the second stanza, the poet speaks throughout as a moralist
or spectator; from first to last he seems to lose all thought of
himself in contemplating the tragedies he foresees for others; the
subject is in fact handled with the most skilful rhetoric, and every
stanza is made to strengthen and elaborate the leading thought. In
the 'Progress of Poesy,' though the general constructive effect is
perhaps inferior to 'The Bard,' we see the same evidence of careful
preconsideration, while the course of the poem is particularly
distinguished by the beauty of the transitions. Of the form of the
'Elegy' it is superfluous to speak; a poem so dignified and yet so
tender, appeals immediately, and will continue to appeal, to the
heart of every Englishman, so long as the care of public liberty and
love of the soil maintain their hold in this country. In this poem,
as indeed in all that Gray ever wrote, we find it his first principle
<i>to prefer his subject to himself;</i> he never forgot that while he was
a man he was also an artist, and he knew that the function of art was
not merely to indulge nature, but to dignify and refine it.</p>

<p>"Yet, in spite of his love of form, there is nothing frigid or
statuesque in the genius of Gray. A vein of deep melancholy,
evidently constitutional, runs through his poetry, and, considering
how little he produced, the number of personal allusions in his
verses is undoubtedly large. But he is entirely free from that
egotism which we have had frequent occasion to blame as the
prevailing vice of modern poetry. For whereas the modern poet thrusts
his private feelings into prominence, and finds a luxury in the
confession of his sorrows, Gray's references to himself are
introduced on public grounds, or, in other words, with a view to
poetical effect. He, like our own bards, is 'condemned to groan,' but
for different reasons&mdash;</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem193">
	<tr><td><small>'The tender for <i>another's</i> pain,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfeeling for his own.'</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>"We have already remarked on the public character of the 'Ode on Eton
College;' but the second stanza of this poem is a pure expression of
individual feeling:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem194">
	<tr><td><small>'Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, fields belov'd in vain!<br>
		&nbsp;Where once my careless childhood play'd,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger yet to pain!<br>
		&nbsp;I feel the gales that from ye blow<br>
		&nbsp;A momentary bliss bestow,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As waving fresh their gladsome wing,<br>
		&nbsp;My weary soul they seem to soothe,<br>
		&nbsp;And, redolent of joy and youth,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To breathe a second spring.'</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Every one will perceive the art which enforces the truth of the
general reflections that follow by the personal experience of the
speaker. Again, the 'Progress of Poesy' closes with a personal
allusion which, as it is a climax, might, if ill-managed, have
appeared arrogant, but which is, in fact, a masterpiece of oratory.
After confessing his own inferiority to Pindar, the poet proceeds:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem195">
	<tr><td><small>'Yet oft before his infant eyes would run<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray,<br>
		&nbsp;With orient hues, unborrow'd of the sun;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way,<br>
		&nbsp;Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate,<br>
		&nbsp;Beneath the Good how far&mdash;but far above the Great!'</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>There is something very noble in the elevated manner in which the
self-complacent triumph of genius, expressed by so many poets from
Ennius downwards, is at once justified and chastened by the
reflection in these lines. We see in them that the poet alludes to
himself in the third person, and he repeats this style in the
'Elegy,' where, after the fourth line, the first personal pronoun is
never again used. How just and beautiful is the turn where, after
contemplating the general lot of the lowly society he is celebrating,
he proceeds to identify his own fate with theirs:</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="poem196">
	<tr><td><small>'For <i>thee</i>, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,<br>
		&nbsp;If, chance, by lonely contemplation led,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,<br>
		<br>
		'Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,' etc.</small></td></tr>
</table>

<p>"The two great characteristics of Gray's poetry that we have
noticed&mdash;his self-suppression and his sense of form and dignity&mdash;are
best described by the word 'classical.' What we particularly admire
in the great authors of Greece and Rome is their public spirit. Their
writings are full of patriotism, good-breeding, and common-sense, and
have that happy mixture of art and nature which is only acquired by
men who have learned from liberty how to discipline individual
instincts by social refinement. Their style is masculine, clear, and
moderate; they seem, as it were, never to lose the sense of being
before an audience, and, like orators who know that they are always
exposed to the judgment of their intellectual equals, they aim at
putting intelligible thoughts into the most natural and forcible
words. Precisely the same qualities are observable in all the best
English writers of the eighteenth century. Addison, Pope, and
Goldsmith are perhaps the most shining examples, but the rest are
'classical' in the sense which we have just indicated; and we can
hardly be wrong in ascribing this common rhetorical instinct to the
intimate connection between the men of thought and the men of action,
which existed both in the free states of antiquity, and in England
under the rule of the aristocracy. With the advance of the eighteenth
century the instinct in English literature seems to grow weaker; the
style of our authors becomes more formal and constrained, and
symptoms of that dislike of society encouraged by the philosophy of
Rousseau more frequently betray themselves. As the poetry of Cowper
shows less social instinct than that of Gray, so Gray himself is
inferior in this respect to Pope and Goldsmith. But his style has the
same lofty public spirit that distinguishes his favourite models, and
no worthier form could be imagined to express the ardour excited in
the heart of a patriotic poet by the rising fortunes of his native
country. We feel that it is in every way fitting that the author of
the 'Elegy' should have been the favourite of Wolfe and the
countryman of Chatham."</p>
